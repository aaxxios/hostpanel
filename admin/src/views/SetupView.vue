/**
 * @description
 * First-run setup for a standalone (`AUTH_MODE=local`) installation.
 *
 * This is the screen a person who has just cloned and started this repository sees. On a
 * genuinely fresh install there are no accounts at all, so it does the whole bootstrap in
 * two steps: create the first account, then claim the Admin role with the setup token the
 * API printed to its log.
 *
 * The claim step runs signed in: `POST /api/auth/setup` is `[Authorize]`, takes no account
 * fields because it grants a role to the caller rather than creating anybody, and answers
 * `{ success }`, never a token.
 *
 * **On an SSO deployment this screen never appears.** The router guard sends it to /login
 * unless the API reported `local` and reported setup as outstanding. Registration is a
 * local-mode concept and under an external sign-on provider its endpoint answers 404;
 * there the setup token is asked for on the sign-in screen instead.
 *
 * Every failure shown here is the sentence the API returned. There are no client-side
 * validation rules: the password rules belong to the server, which is the only place they
 * can actually be enforced.
