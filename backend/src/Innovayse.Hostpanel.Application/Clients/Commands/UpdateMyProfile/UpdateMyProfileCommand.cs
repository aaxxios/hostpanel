/// mailed confirmation, <c>StartMyEmailChangeCommand</c>), and none of the staff-owned fields: currency, billing contact,
/// admin notes, billing settings and status are not on this command at all, so no body can reach
/// them through this route.

/// <param name="LastName">New last name, or null to keep the current one.</param>
/// <param name="CompanyName">New company name (empty to clear), or null to keep the current one.</param>
/// <param name="Phone">New phone number (empty to clear), or null to keep the current one.</param>
/// <param name="Address">New billing address, or null to keep the stored one; a line left null inside it keeps that stored line, an empty one clears it. The country is an ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code.</param>
/// <param name="Language">Preferred UI language code (empty for no preference), or null to keep the current one.</param>
