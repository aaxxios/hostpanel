/// <para>
/// <b>Why this is an order and not a direct registrar call.</b> The obvious mirror of
/// <c>RenewMyDomainHandler</c> would be to settle the caller and dispatch
/// <c>TransferDomainCommand</c> straight away. That command calls the registrar immediately and
/// records a price on the new domain without ever raising an invoice, which is correct for the
/// admin route it was written for, where a person has already decided the transfer is warranted,
/// and wrong for a self-service one, where it would hand out transfers for free.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// A transfer-in is already a thing this platform sells: <c>PlaceOrderCommand</c> accepts an
/// item with <see cref="DomainAction.Transfer"/>, prices it from the TLD table, raises the invoice,
/// and <c>FulfillPaidOrderHandler</c> dispatches <c>TransferDomainCommand</c> once that invoice
/// is paid; refunding automatically if the registrar rejects it. So the shared use case this
/// handler reaches for is the order, not the registrar, and everything downstream of payment is
/// the code the public checkout already runs.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>Where the ownership boundary is.</b> <see cref="PlaceOrderCommand"/> carries no client id
/// either; it resolves the account from the credential inside its own handler. This one calls
/// <see cref="ICurrentUserService.RequireUserId"/> before dispatching anyway, and not for
/// decoration: <c>PlaceOrderHandler</c> treats "no credential" as guest checkout and would
/// register a brand-new account for an anonymous caller. That is a sensible answer at a public
/// checkout and a nonsensical one behind <c>/api/me/domains</c>, so this refuses instead.
