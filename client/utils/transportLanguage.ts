 * The language a request asks the backend to answer in.

 * The C# API resolves the language of every sentence it writes (`detail`, `title`, field
 * messages) from the `X-Language` header alone, so the portal stamps that header on every call:
 * the browser-side transport (`composables/useApi.ts`) sends it to the Nitro routes, and the
 * server-side transport (`server/utils/api.ts`) forwards it to the API. Both validate the value
 * here, so an arbitrary header never reaches the backend and the two hops cannot disagree about
 * which languages exist.
